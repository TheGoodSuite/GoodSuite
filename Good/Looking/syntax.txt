Script and comment tags

- Code is "<:" and ":>" (obviously, there's not quotes)
- Comments are between "<:-" and "-:>" (again, no quotes)
- Comments can be inside or outside code tags

Code

- Code consists of expressions and control structures.
- Expressions are closed off by either a semicolon (;)
  or the end of a code block (:>)
- Control structures consists of:
  - an "opener", which is closed by a colon (:)
  - a body of a mix of zero or more other expressions, 
    direct text (between ":>" and "<:"...) and further 
    control structures.
  - the matching "closer" followed by a semicolon (;)

Expressions

- The value of an expression used at the top level will be
  escaped and then printed to the output.
- Each expression is either a single term or a a number of terms
  with operators between them
- A term is one of:
  - an exprression between brackets ('(' and ')')
  - a call to a function, in the form of: 
    "functionname(argument)" where arguments is a comma-seperated
    list of of expressions
  - A literal:
    - Integer (e.g. 12331)
    - Float (e.g. 546.456)
    - String (e.g. "bla" or 'asdas')
    - Boolean (true or false, case insensitive)
  - A variable:
    - consisting of a dollar sign ($) one letter and one or more
      letters and/or numbers
    - a variable will evaluate to the value it was registered with
      by the php code that requested this template to be parsed or
      to the current value assigned to it by a control structure

Functions

- No functions have been implemented yet, so it's not yet valid 
  to use them
- Quite a number of function are planned, but the some of the 
  most urgent ones are:
  - include() (what's the value of a template system without it?)
  - noEscape() (print things to the output without escaping)

Operators

- The available operators are:
  - + (addition)
  - - (subtraction)
  - * (multiplication)
  - / (division)
  - % (modulus)
  - . (concatenation)
  - == (type insensitive equality)
  - === (type sensitive equality)
  - != (type insensitive inequality)
  - !== (type sensitive inequality)
  - > (greater than)
  - < (less than)
  - <= (less or equal)
  - >= (greater or equal)
  - && (logical and)
  - and (alternative logical and)
  - || (logical or)
  - or (alternative logical or)
  - xor (logical exclusive or)
- the unary operator logical not (!) is planned, but not implemented
  if you need it now, you can use "!= true" instead

Control Structures:

The control structures are:
	- if (condition): {body} endif;
      {body} will be if the expression condition evaluates to true
      
	- foreach(array as $varName): {body} endforeach;
      {body} will be executed once for each element in the collection
      (arrray or Traversable) - $varName will take the value of one of
      the elements in the collection each time, following the order of
      the collection
      
	- forrange(beginValue --> endValue) {body} endforrange;
      {body} will be executed once for beginValue, once for
      endValue and once for each integer in between.
      Both beginValue and endValue are expressions which will
      be casted to integers.
      
    - forrange(beginValue --> endValue as $var) {body} endforrange;
      behaves like the previous entry, but also has $var take the
      values in the range (starting as beginValue, decreasing one
      each time if endValue is lower than beginValue and increasing
      once each time if endValue is higher than beginValue)
      $var will take the number of elements in the range after the
      loop is done
