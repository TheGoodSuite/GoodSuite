<:<:- TEST -:>:>

<:- 
	this is a sample template for my Templating system
	Please do acknowledge that I am writing this file while my system can't even parse
	a variable yet - so this is just a guideline for myself, not a file that is guaranteed to work
	
	Comment-syntax is like in the case of this piece of text, the comment delimiters are <:- and - : > (remove space,
	I just wanted to make sure I did not break this comment)
	Script delimiters are <: and :>
	A comment may be inside script-tags or outside - it doesn't really matter
-:>

<:- 
	This sample script want the following variables to be registered:
		logged_in - whether the user is logged in
		loginpage - whether this is a page you can log in on
		name - current user's name
		title - page's title
		mainText - the main text for the page
		newspapers - an array of newspapers
			newspapers[] - any of these newspapers is again an array of articles
				newspapers[][Article] - each of these articles is an array with properties of the article
					newspapers[][Article]['name']
					newspapers[][Article]['date']
					newspapers[][Article]['time']
					newspapers[][Article]['viewCount']
					newspapers[][Article]['reviews'] - an array of review for the article
						newspapers[][Article]['reviews'][] - each member of this array is array of properties
						newspapers[][Article]['reviews'][][0] - href
						newspapers[][Article]['reviews'][][1] - image
						newspapers[][Article]['reviews'][][2] - title
					newspapers[][Article]['price'] - price to read full article
					newspapers[][Article]['buy-now'] - array of buy-now properties
					newspapers[][Article]['buy-now']['present'] - whether or not the buy-now possibility is there
					newspapers[][Article]['buy-now']['link'] - a link to the respective buy-now page
		newspaperLinks[] - takes the name of a newspaper and holds it's link
		newspaperNames[] - takes a newspaper number and holds it's name
		ourFriendsCount - the amount of friends that should be drawn at the bottom of the page
		insertFooter - whether or not a footer should be inserted
		footer - is "randomFooter" when a random footer should be included
		
	Now, that's quite a few variables and some quite complicated arrays. This won't be too common (I hope)
	in applications (that aren't too complicated themselves), but here I wanted to show the full extend of
	the system.
-:>

<html>
<head>
<title>Page's Name - <:title:></title>
</head>
<body>
<h1><:title:></h1>

<:if (logged_in):>
	<p>Welcome <:name <:- This is the user's name (just trying out a comment within code tags -:>:></p>
<:else:>
	<: if (<:- currently ! is not supported (while != is), so Icomment it out here !--:>loginpage):>
	<:- if we're on the loginpage already, there's no need to display an additional message -:>
		<p>Welcome, guest. Please register or log in</p>
		<:- We do ask people to please register or log in, but we do not restrict them if they don't -:>
	<:end if:>
<:end if:>

<:-
I haven't made the menu file yet, so it is commented out -- fictional :P
<:include('menu.html'):>
-:>

<:- The main text may again include tags - at least that is what I would like -:>
<:- Seriously, just <i>what</i> was I thinking? -:>
<:- Just like included files should be allowed to use tags again -:>
<:- Sure, they should, but they are not like variables in the least bit -:>
<p><:mainText:></p>

<:foreach(newspaper in newspapers):>
	<table border="1">
	
	<:- nameForCounter is a function that binds a name to a counter that keeps
		number of iterations that have been in the topmost for or foreach loop -:>
	
	<:- Functions are not yet supported <:nameForCounter(newspaperNumber):> -:>
	
	<:foreach (article in newspaper):>
		<tr>
		<td><:article['name']:></td>
		<td><:article['date']; ' - '; article['time']:></td>
		<:- and we're gonna cheat a little :D -:>
		<td>views: <: 10 + article['viewCount']:></td>
		
		<td>
		<:foreach (review in article['reviews']):>
			<a href='<:review[0]:>'><img src='<:review[1]:>' />
			<:review[2]:></a><br />
		<:end foreach:>
		</td>
		
		<:- if the price is 2 or lower it should be displayed in red - so gets the redPrice class,
		    otherwise it gets the price class. I know multiclassing would be a better solution to the
			problem, but that was not what I wanted to show - remember this a sample <i>template</i> -:>
			
		<td class='<:if (article['price'] <= 2):>redPrice<:else:>price<:end if:>'>&euro;<:article['price']:></td>
		
		<:- if a buy-now link is present, put it in, otherwise, refer to newspaper site
			this displays both the use of multidimentional arrays (they have been used before, but only with
			foreach) and a nice multiline statement
			
			I decided also to put an array with a variable between the brackets here, informationdesnity is really
			high in this example :P	Please not that I broke this up into multiple lines because that looked better,
			there should be no need to do so
			
			it's not exactly elegant, but then again I am trying to achieve the limits of my system here -:>
		
		<td><:if (article['buy-now']['present'] == true); 
			     article['buy-now']['link'];
			  else; 
				 <:- we do not have newspapernumber at this moment, because functions
				     are not yet supported, thus I made up some alternative to what's below:
					 newspaperLinks[newspaperNames[newspaperNumber]]; -:>
				 "Buy-now not present!";
			  end if; :></td>
			
		</tr>
	<:end foreach:>
	
	</table>
<:end foreach:>

<:for(1 --> ourFriendsCount) :>
	<img src='friend.jpg' />
<:end for:>

<:if (insertFooter == true && footer != "randomFooter"):>
	<:<:- functions are not supported right now include(-:>'footer.html'<:-)-:>:>
<:end if:>
